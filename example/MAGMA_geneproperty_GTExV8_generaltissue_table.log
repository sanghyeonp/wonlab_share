Running MAGMA property analysis of GTEx v8 general tissue to table...
Column description: Beta and Beta.Std is the non-standardized and semi-standardized regression coefficient from generalized linear regression described in [1]. SE is the standard error of the non-standardized regression coefficient. P value is derived with a one-tailed Z-tests of Beta divided by SE (not adjusted for multiple testing).
