Computing Cohen's kappa coefficient:
	Reference: ./data/GWAS1.subset.csv
	Alternative: ./data/GWAS2.subset.tsv
SNP list was provided through FUMA `leadSNPs.txt`.1650 SNPs were specified.
Number of SNPs in reference: 1650
Number of SNPs in alternative: 1650
Number of SNPs in both reference and alternative: 1650

$Result

	Estimate Cohen's kappa statistics and test the null hypothesis that
	the extent of agreement is same as random (kappa=0)

data:  df_$beta.ref.c and df_$beta.alt.c
Z = 35.106, p-value < 2.2e-16
